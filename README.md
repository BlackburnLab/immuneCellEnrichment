Integration of heterogeneous and voluminous data from proteomics, transcriptomics, Immunological and clinical research constitutes not only a fundamental problem but a real hurdle in the extraction of valuable information from these omics data sets. The exponential increase of novel omics technologies such as LC-MS/MS and the generation of high-resolution data from large consortia projects generates heterogenous and big data sets. These big data promote research but at the same time, new methodologies are lacking in sophisticated tools to analyse these complex data sets. The overall aim of my PhD research project is to carry out an integration of proteomic, transcriptomic, immunological and clinical datasets generated on individuals who have been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli and who either have or have not become infected. More specifically, we have recruited a unique cohort of individuals who have either a latent tuberculosis infection, have had previous TB or who have had recurrent bouts of TB, as well as health care workers and household contacts of TB index cases who have remained long-term tuberculin skin test negative (i.e. presumed uninfected) and who may therefore have sterilizing immunity to TB. We have then made parallel proteomic, transcriptomic and immunology measurements on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from the different groups of participants following directed infusion into the lungs of M. bovis BCG or purified protein derivative (of M. tuberculosis; ‘PPD’). This unique human lung challenge model of tuberculosis disease looks set to radically alter our understanding of immunological responses to exposure to M. tuberculosis, yet there are currently few bioinformatic tools available to enable data integration in this area. In this research, we set to integrate clinical proteomics datasets with corresponding proteomics, transcriptomics and immunological data from the same individuals in having different grades of infection with M. tuberculosis. We shall also do the integration of clinical and immunological samples which is expected to provide a new insight of bio-markers of TB disease from TB-HART samples. Another related objective will be to develop a data integration method using clinical, immunological and transcriptomics data. This research will be expected to provide a novel holistic view of correlates of risk at the site of infection- the human lung..
